 * and where to put a missing value. Nobody agreed on the second. Nulls that
 * sort first push every incomplete record to the top of a list, which is
 * exactly the opposite of what a reader wants from "sort by date".
 *
 * So: missing values always sort LAST, in both directions. A record with no
 * date is not the oldest record; it is a record with no date, and it belongs at
 * the bottom whichever way the arrow points.
